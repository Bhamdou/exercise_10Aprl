In this exercise, we created a Python program that performs image classification using the TensorFlow and Keras libraries.
We loaded the pre-trained ResNet50 model for image classification and an image for classification.
We pre-processed the image and performed classification using the model.
Finally, we displayed the top predicted classes and their probabilities.
